We are using Prettier for formatting
If using VS Code, go to extensions and type Prettier, click install

If using something else, you can format with Prettier from the command line. 

Use:
npx prettier . --write 

"Prettier --write". is great for formatting everything, but for a big project it might take a little while. You may run prettier --write app/ to format a certain directory, or prettier --write app/components/Button.js to format a certain file. Or use a glob like prettier --write "app/**/*.test.js" to format all tests in a directory.

For more information about using Prettier go to https://prettier.io/docs/install
